# Web-Spotify-Playlist-Expander
This is a music discovery tool. This project creates a new custom playlist based on the first five songs of a selected playlist. The playlist is generated using the spotify web api. The number of songs on the new playlist, tempo, popularity, instrumentalness, danceability, and valence of the songs on the playlist are customizeable.
